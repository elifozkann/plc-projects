## üöÄ Projects

### **Photo Sensor Conveyor System**
- **System Used:** Siemens S7-1200, TIA Portal, SIMATIC HMI  
- **Description:** Designed a conveyor system controlled by photo sensors for object detection, enabling forward/reverse motor operation and visual/audible alarms during fault conditions.  
- **Key Features:**
  - Ladder logic for motor control
  - Photo sensor and limit switch integration
  - Error handling and interlock logic
  - HMI interface for real-time control

### **Timer-Based Conveyor Belt System**
- **System Used:** Siemens S7-1200, PLCSIM, HMI  
- **Description:** Implemented a conveyor belt system controlled by Start/Stop and Emergency Stop buttons using a TON timer for process timing.  
- **Key Features:**
  - Timer-based process control
  - Emergency stop safety integration
  - PLCSIM simulation testing

---

### **Counter and Fault Management System**
- **System Used:** Siemens S7-1200, TIA Portal  
- **Description:** Developed a CTU counter-based automation system with alarm and reset functions for product counting and fault management.  
- **Key Features:**
  - CTU counter blocks for counting
  - Reset and alarm logic
  - Combined timer and counter operation
  - HMI visualization for operator interface

---

### **Dual Motor Production Simulation**
- **System Used:** Siemens S7-1200, HMI  
- **Description:** Designed a coordinated control system for two motors (‚ÄúBox Motor‚Äù and ‚ÄúBall Motor‚Äù) using counter-based automation.  
- **Key Features:**
  - Sequential motor control using counters
  - Conditional JMP logic
  - Real-time HMI visualization
